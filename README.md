## Swift, Server-side, Serverless

This is the code repository for session DEV334 "Swift, Server-side, Serverless" @ AWS re:Invent 2024

**Abstract**: Full stack developers hate to switch programming languages, tools, frameworks. It’s a loss of time. What if you could use your favorite frontend language, Swift, to build your backend resources, such as API, or any type of cloud-based processing? What if you don’t even need to deploy a virtual machine to do so? During this code talk, learn why you should use Swift on the server and how you can generate Swift server-side code from an OpenAPI specification and deploy it to AWS Lambda serverless functions.
